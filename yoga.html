                    Generally, it is recognised as an ancient system of philosophies, principles and practices derived from the 
                    Vedic tradition of India and the Himalayas, more than 2500 years ago. It is a system that recognises the 
                    multi-dimensional nature of the human person, and primarily relates to the nature and workings of the mind, 
                    based on experiential practice and self-enquiry.
                    <br><br>
                    In Yoga, the body, breath and mind are seen as a union of these multi-dimensional aspects of each and every 
                    human being. The system and various techniques of Yoga cultivate the experience of that union, leading to 
                    greater integration of being, internal peacefulness, and clarity of the mind. It is a system that is designed 
                    to cultivate health and happiness, and a greater sense of self-awareness and higher consciousness.

                <h4> Benefits of yoga </h4>
                <p>
                    Yoga offers physical and mental health benefits for people of all ages. And, if you’re going through an 
                    illness, recovering from surgery or living with a chronic condition, yoga can become an integral part 
                    of your treatment and potentially hasten healing. 
                    <br> <br>
                    A yoga therapist can work with patients and put together individualized plans that work together with 
                    their medical and surgical therapies. That way, yoga can support the healing process and help the person
                    experience symptoms with more centeredness and less distress.

                <h3> Why do people close their during Yoga?.</h3>
                <p>
                    The human eye transmits almost 10 MILLION bits of information to the brain per second, which can overwhelm our 
                    system & lessen our ability to engage with other senses. This is why we frequently unconsciously compensate by 
                    closing our eyes when we want to feel, hear, taste & smell more deeply.
                    <br>
                    In yoga, pratyahara is the practice of depriving the senses & gaining control over external influences.
                     It’s often referred to as the ‘forgotten limb of yoga.’ In today’s information age, we’ve gotten so used 
                     to eagerly absorbing all of the available information that we’ve turned away from intentionally shutting 
                     superficial information out.

                <h4>Why do people do yoga in a group?.</h4>
                <p>
                    Group yoga refers to a style of yoga practice in which the participants work together to form the poses. 
                    Rather than each yogi performing a specific pose, as in a traditional yoga class, the yogis in group yoga 
                    each form a different limb of one bigger pose or assist each other in the poses.
                </p>
                <h4>According to Yogipedia:</h4>
                <p>
                    Partner yoga is one form of group yoga, but the term is often used to refer to practices involving more than 
                    two people. With the assistance of another person or persons, the yogis are able to go deeper in the poses. 
                    Acro yoga, which combines acrobatics and yoga, is another type of group yoga, as is a choreographed dance 
                    style of yoga.<br>
                    One example of a group yoga pose is the human mandala, in which the yogis sit in a circle facing each other 
                    with feet touching and then cross their arms and grasp the hands of the yogi on either side. Another example 
                    would be a pyramid formed with two or more yogis posing as the base in a pose like downward-facing dog or 
                    table pose, and then one or more yogis posing atop the base.
