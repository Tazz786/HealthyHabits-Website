                <h4>What is Stretching good for body?.</h4>
                <p>
                    You may think of stretching as something performed only by runners or gymnasts. But we all need to 
                    stretch in order to protect our mobility and independence. "A lot of people don't understand that 
                    stretching has to happen on a regular basis. It should be daily," says David Nolan, a physical therapist 
                    at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.

                    Stretching keeps the muscles flexible, strong, and 
                    healthy, and we need that flexibility to maintain a 
                    range of motion in the joints. Without it, the muscles shorten and become tight. Then, when you call on 
                    the muscles for activity, they are weak and unable to extend all the way..

                <h4> Benefits of Stretching before exercise</h4>
                <p>
                    The importance of stretching is something we learn at a young age. It helps to loosen up your muscles 
                    both before and after a workout to prevent them from becoming stiff. Stretching helps our bodies prepare 
                    for physical activity in order to stay safe and healthy while we exercise. Stretching is also a fundamental 
                    component of many physical therapy treatment plans, as it helps to strengthen and support muscles after an 
                    injury. It can also help prevent injuries from developing in the future when done properly and regularly.

                    Other reason could be that Stretching relieves your pain. Stretching increases your flexibility and range of 
                    motion. In doing so, it is also able to prevent muscle injury and reduce the pain and discomfort you may be 
                    feeling in certain areas. Daily stretches can provide increased levels of comfort when performing everyday 
                    motions that may be bothering you.
                    <br>
                    Stretching decreases your stress. Stretching is a great way to relieve stress. Stress is carried in different 
                    parts of the body, including the neck, back, and shoulders. By stretching those common problem areas, you can 
                    find physical and emotional relief from the stresses you may be carrying there. Since stretching is such a 
                    common recommendation for stress relief, many people will take to yoga in order to find relief.

                <h4> What happens if you dont stretch</h4>

                    Your Body Will Become More Vulnerable to Muscle Pain and Tightness. Without regular stretching, your body 
                    gets cold, and your muscles tighten up. Eventually, your muscles will pull on your joints and trigger 
                    significant pain and discomfort. If your muscles could talk, they’d be saying, Stretch Me. 
                    People who maintain an active lifestyle would head down to the gym after a long day at work. Once they’ve 
                    put in a good hour of workout, they would want to get home, enjoy their dinner, and relax before getting a good
                     night’s sleep.
                    <br>
                    If you’re one of those who jet home after an invigorating workout, you might want to incorporate a post-workout 
                    stretch into your fitness routine. Experts agree that forgetting to stretch your muscles after a run or a session 
                    at a gym could do your body more harm than good.

                    Weak back and abdominal muscles can cause or worsen low back pain. That's why stretching and strengthening 
                    your back and abdominal muscles are important not only for treating low back pain, but also for helping 
                    to prevent a recurrence of the problem.
